    <h1>Akan names</h1>
    <div class="composition">
      <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of
         the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These
         "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of
         the person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer
         to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.
         This naming tradition is shared throughout West Africa and the
         African diaspora.Many of the leaders of slave rebellions had
         "day names" including Cuffy or Kofi,
         Cudjoe or Kojo,and Quamina or Kwame/Kwamina.</p>
